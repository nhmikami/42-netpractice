This project is a simulation that challenges us to troubleshoot computer networks by configuring routers and hosts using IP addressing and routing principles. The goal is to understand how data travels through networks and how to ensure proper communication between different subnets and hosts.

## Network
A **network** is a group of two or more devices (like computers, smartphones, servers, or routers) that are connected and able to communicate with each other to share data and resources.

The **Internet** is the largest network in the world. It's actually a network of networks, meaning it's made up of thousands of smaller networks all connected together.
Each time you an e-mail is sent or a website is opened, data is sent through many routers and networks, all cooperating to deliver the request. The data hops between different routers and IP addresses, following paths based on routing rules, until it reaches its destination.

## IP Address & Subnet Mask
An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) uniquely identifies a device on a network, while the **subnet mask** defines the range of IPs within the same network. These two work together to determine which part of the IP identifies the network and the host.

## Routing
Routers use routing tables to decide where to forward packets. Each entry in the table defines a destination network and a next hop (usually another router or interface).
